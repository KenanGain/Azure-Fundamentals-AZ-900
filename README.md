## üèÜ Answers & Explanations

1. **B. You only pay for resources you consume, with no upfront commitment**  
   - Azure‚Äôs pay-as-you-go pricing ensures you only pay for what you use without long-term contracts.

2. **C. Azure SQL Database**  
   - Azure SQL Database is a fully managed PaaS database.  
   - (VMs are IaaS, AKS is managed Kubernetes [Container as a Service], Blob Storage is object storage.)

3. **C. Configuring Network Security Groups (NSGs) and access controls**  
   - Customers manage network security rules, data encryption, and identity access.  
   - Microsoft handles physical security, hypervisor patching, and hardware maintenance.

4. **A. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**  
   - Azure AD provides centralized identity, authentication, and access control for Azure resources.

5. **B. Azure Functions**  
   - Azure Functions is a serverless, event-driven compute service.  
   - App Service is a PaaS web hosting platform; Container Instances are serverless containers.

6. **B. Cool Tier**  
   - Cool tier is cost-optimized for infrequently accessed data with low retrieval latency.  
   - Archive tier is for long-term archival and has higher retrieval latency.

7. **B. Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances (1-year or 3-year term)**  
   - Committing to Reserved Instances yields significant discounts for sustained workloads.  
   - Spot VMs are inexpensive but can be evicted; Pay-as-you-go has no commitment.

8. **B. Azure Pricing Calculator**  
   - The Azure Pricing Calculator lets you estimate costs based on resource configurations.

9. **C. Follow best practices to build secure, reliable, and efficient solutions**  
   - The Azure Well-Architected Framework outlines design principles across five pillars.  
   - It does not automate scaling or define region pairings.

10. **B. Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set spanning multiple AZs behind an Azure Load Balancer**  
    - Scale Sets automatically distribute VM instances across AZs, and the Load Balancer provides fault tolerance.  
    - Single VM (A) is not highly available; Blob Storage (C) is for static content; Functions with Event Grid (D) handle event-driven tasks, not classic web hosting.
